# Roadmap

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The above roadmap may just mean nothing to you - another boring and typical network launch timeline. You are correct. The team will build with it as a reference, but more importantly we take an _ecosystem first_ approach. Users, solvers and community members are the core of the Nimble ecosystem.

What does it mean to users, solvers and community members?

### For users

As of December 1, 2023 our testnet is now publicly available. Going forward, we will be prioritizing features according to user feedback. You can ask on Discord and Twitter and we will prioritize!

### For solvers

You will be able to participate in the network starting Q1 2024. After that, what intents you can solve depend on what users want. We are here together to serve users.

### For community

You may also care about tokens. We do not have an exact timeline yet. When to launch the network token depends on how fast we grow together.

_Let us build and cheese! You will shape the future of Nimble._
