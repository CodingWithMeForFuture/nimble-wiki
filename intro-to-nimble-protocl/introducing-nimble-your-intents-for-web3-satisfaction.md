# Introducing Nimble - Your Intents for Web3 Satisfaction

## What Are Intents?

Intents are outcome driven messages signed by users. Intents are desirable user specified state rather than instructions like transactions. Example intents are:

* Stake ETH for best yields
* Trade USDC for ETH at the optimal price
* Swap USDC for ETH with minimum slippage of 0.1%

Intents focus on user preferences, the product journey and the desired protocol outcomes.

## The Protocol for Optimal Web3 UX

It is unimaginable that users have to specify which videos to be recommended explicitly, which driver to take a ride, and which posts to show on the homepage. Yet, that is the reality in Web3 now. You need to specify swap, trade, stake and farming operations and make it as a transaction in complex DeFi, SocialFi and other protocols.

Meanwhile, in today’s blockchain world, transactions are published to mempool without competition mechanisms. This introduces MEV problems when searchers can re-order the transactions with their computation and algorithm advantages.

Nimble, an intent layer in the blockchain world, hides low level protocol complexities like operating systems in today’s computers. Today’s blockchains are similar to computers in the old days, in which users have to install hardware drivers to start using the computer. With Nimble, you do not need to worry about which protocols to interact with, frustrations associated with bridging operations, and the stress with token transfers in wallets.
