# FAQs

1. What is the project vision?

Nimble is _**decentralizing Silicon Valley**_ with the intent marketplace infrastructure design.

The internet is the most powerful connective force in history. Billions of people across the globe communicate and transact in real time.

Despite the near-zero marginal cost of online interaction, digital citizens must pay outsized fees to rent-collecting platform middlemen.

Nimble is eliminating the boundary between the mainstream and decentralized web. Our intent-powered marketplace will provide a neutral accessibility layer to enable seamless access to decentralized services. A competitive ecosystem of sovereign infrastructure providers and end users replaces centralized platforms.

In the same way that Google made the worldâ€™s data accessible to all, Nimble aims to democratize the exchange of value.

For more details, please refer to our [vision doc](https://docs.nimble.technology/).

2. What is the project roadmap?

Nimble is to enable intent demand by end of Q1 2024. This is followed by marketplace distribution mechanism in Q2 2024. The infrastructure launch will happen by end of Q3 2024.

For more details, please refer to our [roadmap doc](https://docs.nimble.technology/intent-solicitation/roadmap).

3. When will Nimble do exchange token listing?

To be aligned with the roadmap above, the token listing will happen right after the infrastructure launch by Q3 2024. If the infrastructure launch happens earlier than expected, the token listing will be ahead of the schedule as well.

4. What is Nimble tokenomics?

The following table shows high level token distributions. Please refer to the [tokenomics](https://docs.nimble.technology/intent-solicitation/tokenomics) doc for more info.

| Category       | Locked  | Unlocked | Total   |
| -------------- | ------- | -------- | ------- |
| Ecosystem      | 27      | 3        | 50      |
| Solver Rewards | 18      | 2        | 20      |
| Community      | 0       | 10       | 10      |
| Development    | 20      | 0        | 10      |
| Private Sales  | 20      | 0        | 10      |
| **Total**      | **85%** | **15%**  | **100** |

5. How to become solvers?

Once the solver SDKs are released, any developer can contribute and become solvers following our solver governance policy. The policy will be released once it is ready. It is expected solvers can contribute starting end of Q1 2024.

6. What are the potential security attacks and how to make the network secure?

There are various attack vectors, which are fully discussed in our [security blog](https://docs.nimble.technology/practical-intents/intent-verification-and-security).

7. What intents and applications will be supported?

Nimble is building an Everything Intent Marketplace infrastructure. The network supports generic purpose intents. It includes but not limited to an ecosystem built around AI intents, social intents, DeFi intents, offline service intents and more.\
\
To jumpstart the network, Nimble will launch AI intents with [large action model](https://docs.nimble.technology/practical-intents/natural-language-intents), social intents with decentralized community design and DeFi intents for better Web3 UX.\
\
After that, developers can build DApps for any types of intent DApps.

For more info about the intent design, please refer to the [whitepaper](https://docs.nimble.technology/intent-digest/whitepaper) and [applications blog](https://docs.nimble.technology/intent-solicitation/marketplace-applications).

8. What are the network key innovations?

The network key innovations are discussed [here](https://docs.nimble.technology/intent-digest/key-innovations) for generic and scalable intent support.

9. How to achieve network scalability?

The network is scalable with the unique network auction design and efficient intent dispatching algorithm.

For more info, please refer to the [whitepaper](https://docs.nimble.technology/intent-digest/whitepaper) for detailed modular auction design discussions, and [matching system blog](https://docs.nimble.technology/practical-intents/intent-matching-and-dispatching) for efficient matching and dispatching design discussions.

10. How to get community roles

Pre-Beta: Everyone who joins before our mainnet beta launch (Targeted EOY 2023)

BFF: Follow us on Twitter

Cheese: Complete a cheese challenge

nimBull: OG channel joiners (or people who bring the heat)&#x20;

Curdled: For trolls/spammers&#x20;

11. How to become community managers or moderators?

Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/9VgEwsA7xJ) and start contributing first. Then, you will naturally have opportunities to become community managers or moderators.

12. What is the GTM strategy?

Nimble builds the social and large action model first to jumpstart the network. This is followed by the infrastructure ecosystem building. The [roadmap](https://docs.nimble.technology/intent-solicitation/roadmap) has more detailed info on how to achieve this.

13. What is the network token utility and revenue model for the token?

Token appreciations come from infrastructure intent fees, intent bids quoted by network token, and solver staking.
