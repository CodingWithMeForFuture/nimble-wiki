# Roadmap

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We aim to swiftly deploy a protocol facilitating miners and developers to build enterprise-grade AI products through composability. With aggressive timelines and execution plans, we have two remaining roadmap phases.

First, our **mainnet launch** is set for Q1 2024, allowing miners to contribute to the network and developers to leverage composability.

The second phase, **Ecosystem Growth**, supports projects building on Nimble to expand our ecosystem further.
