# Introducing Nimble Protocol

## Abstract

_The internet has revolutionized almost every aspect of the modern world. Data from billions of devices, people, and systems is exchanged every day._

_Web3 promised to facilitate the transfer of not just data, but value, between these digital entities. Trusted intermediaries were to be replaced with trustless, decentralized systems._&#x20;

_In practice, Web3 failed to live up to this promise. Even basic operations are complex and opaque. Centralized tools exist to simplify interactions, but negate the system’s original purpose entirely._

_Nimble aims to unlock the utility of Web3 by building the first marketplace for intents. Our protocol will provide an open and inclusive market for participants to compete to optimize outcomes instead of maximizing extracted value._

_In the same way that Google made the world’s data accessible to all, Nimble aims to democratize the exchange of value._

### The Connected Era

The early internet was quite different from what we have today. In the days of Web 1.0, we created and shared content on a network of niche microsites. Publishing content on Web 1.0 was prohibitively complex, with users needing to learn an emerging technology just to post a photo or article. The content was read-only and mostly shared through plain old links, so reaching a large audience was rare.

What use is owning your own corner of the internet if no one is listening?

The solution to these problems was the bright idea that spawned the modern internet - Web2. The answer to the fragmentation of Web 1.0 was consolidation. Rather than creating our own website to host the content we create, we share our content on platforms dedicated to the medium to be shared.&#x20;

Platforms dramatically simplify the way we interact with the web. Sharing a photo of your cat is just a few taps away, and the billions of users almost guarantee an audience.&#x20;

The degree of consolidation has become extreme. In 2021, the top 6 tech platforms accounted for well over half of all traffic on the internet. Platforms have become synonymous with the type of content they distribute. YouTube owns video content. Google owns search. Twitch owns live streaming.

Except they don’t own them at all. YouTube doesn’t record videos. Google doesn’t write the text content they index. Twitch doesn’t livestream. What these platforms really own is us. The product they provide is access to an audience that we both embody and require. The undeniable simplicity of platforms comes at a cost.

Data about platform usage is carefully cataloged and sold to anyone with the money to pay for it. This data is routinely used as a lever to sway your purchase behavior, fueling incredibly accurate ad targeting. There are also financial costs, with content creators on platforms like YouTube and Twitch paying 45% of all revenue to the platforms.

We believe that Web 3.0 can serve as the foundation for a new Internet that combines the freedom of the early Internet with the simplicity of the modern platform-dominated Internet. This will require solving the profound usability challenges blocking the widespread adoption of blockchain today. Doing so will enable a re-balancing of control away from tech monopolies and towards everyday internet users.

#### Requirements for a Free Internet

Building a better internet has two fundamental requirements.

First, the solution must be at least as easy to use as today’s internet. To benefit from growth by network effects, we cannot afford to exclude participants. As of today, no solution built on the blockchain is simple enough for use by the mass market. To perform operations as basic as sending tokens from one account to another, we need to understand a significant amount of technical jargon and architectural details. This complexity halts network effects. If a product’s most passionate proponents cannot drive adoption by their immediate peer group, it cannot grow through network effects.

Crypto pros have become a meme in today’s culture largely for this reason. They are passionate about the technology but are unable to articulate the value because it is too difficult to realize.

To appeal to the broader market, applications must hide this complexity from users in its entirety. Users must interact only with entities they can understand without background learning.&#x20;

Second, the solution must address the problems with today’s internet. There are three common objections to the platforms dominating the internet today:

1. Privacy concerns. Selling personal information is an accepted fact of today’s internet. A better internet would put users in control of their own data in a completely transparent way.
2. Bias. The content we view on today’s platforms is curated by opaque algorithms, leading to a widespread loss of trust in big tech. A better internet would make ranking algorithms transparent, so users could understand exactly why content appears on their feed, and allow them to select alternative ranking methods.
3. Monopolization. Today, platforms can charge content creators whatever they want because the platform owns the audience. Users, not the platforms, should own user-created data and content.

### An Inclusive Ecosystem

#### The Nimble Protocol

Nimble Protocol will unlock the utility of Web3 by building the first-ever intent marketplace.

The protocol enables the general public to interact with Web3 technology without learning specialized jargon or architecture details. Users operate in a world they can understand - stating outcomes they are willing to accept. Nimble then translates the user’s desired outcomes into computational steps and routes them to participants that are capable of satisfying them.

Developers and institutions can extend the protocol to offer potential solutions to user problems, competing to provide the best possible solution. Every layer of Nimble is extensible by design to encourage a free and open marketplace where competition benefits users and developers alike.

#### An Intentional Design

Our protocol consists of three main elements that come together to accomplish our vision. It all starts with the input to the system called “Intents”. An Intent is the outcome a user would like to achieve, structured as plain language.&#x20;

The protocol interprets Intents, and uses AI to translate them into machine-readable instructions. These instructions are sent to “Dispatchers” to be routed appropriately. Participants may run their own dispatchers, earning tokens for routing intents.

Dispatchers bundle intents and send them to multiple “Solvers” to propose a solution. Solvers compete to provide the best solution for Intent based on user preferences, and only the best solution is chosen.

For each desired outcome a user has, many Solvers may be needed, each performing a specialized function. Functions include DeFi operations, arbitrage activities, and cross-domain intents to be fulfilled across multiple protocols. Solutions from multiple solvers can be composed to satisfy intents that require multiple distinct operations.

The work Solvers perform may be computationally expensive, so solvers are compensated for the work they do on our network. Nimble collects a small fee for each transaction and directs it to the Solver that proposes the best solution.

#### Blockchain First

Every component of our protocol is built on the blockchain. Since blockchains eliminate the need for trusted intermediate entities, they are the ideal technology for building a freer internet. Most importantly, they are fully decentralized, allowing users to own and control their data, audiences, and outcomes.

#### AI Agents

The core modules of the network (i.e., intent understanding, intent matching with solvers, and solver algorithms) will be AI models. They operate as AI agents to fulfill the network functionalities. Thus, the key to decentralization is a network that runs AI models in an open, public, and decentralized way. AI agents perform the key functionalities and earn network tokens as rewards.

This network will be opened to the public for more generic AI models by enabling more use cases like distributing most revenues to content creators in the future etc. In this way, we can support more intent types in the future. Users can get a share of the AI models by contributing data or purchasing.

#### Privacy and Security

The network is secured and governed by consensus algorithms. Solvers stake tokens to participate in the network operations, as in Proof of Stake networks. Users may also wish to keep their intents private. By using zero-knowledge proofs, zk-dispatchers may be used to bundle Intents in a way that preserves the user’s privacy.

### Building for Inclusion

Without an accessibility layer, the development and use of blockchains will remain out of reach for most. It is vital we lower the barrier of entry to unleash the potential of the next generation of the internet. To deliver these meaningful outcomes to users, thousands of developers and institutions must be incentivized to participate.

We imagine a fully open marketplace where participants can compete freely to satisfy each other’s desired outcomes and be compensated for doing so.

When these tools and services can be built on the Nimble protocol, the future of the internet may be a lot brighter.

#### Let's Play

Imagine a small startup creates a new type of crypto wallet on the Nimble protocol. Once tokens are deposited from an exchange, the fact that blockchain operations are occurring is completely transparent. The wallet describes itself as the Hub for Web 3.0 - the only app you need to interact with projects on the blockchain.

Leveraging Intents, users can move tokens effortlessly between projects without learning any technical details or terms. To play an exciting new Web 3.0 game, users could simply click to launch the game. Under the hood, the Hub could structure the user’s interaction into an intent - “Transfer tokens from my main wallet into my wallet in the game”.

The Nimble protocol could translate this intent into the transactions needed to accomplish the user’s goal. First, the user’s main wallet tokens must be swapped to the token type needed in the game. Then, the game tokens need to be transferred into the user’s wallet in the game. If the user did not have a wallet supporting the game token, they are prompted to create one during the launch of the game, prior to submitting the Intent.

Dispatchers on Nimble would search out a Solver capable of swapping the user’s tokens into the game's tokens. Then, an additional Solver would be employed to transfer the user’s game tokens into their game wallet.

Solvers would compete to provide the best exchange rate from the user’s source tokens into the game token, even if multiple swaps are needed.

From the user’s perspective, they merely clicked a button to launch the game. The Hub took care of the hard part and was compensated accordingly.

#### A Simple Exchange

Imagine a decentralized exchange aggregator built on an intent marketplace. Individual exchanges operate by creating liquidity pools that facilitate the transfer of tokens between each token in the pool. Each trade with the liquidity pool incurs a fee, and the exchange rate approximates the true exchange rate between the tokens on the public market.

Imagine a user submits an intent to the exchange aggregator, attempting to exchange 1 ETH for BTC at the market rate. The Nimble protocol will attempt to match the intent with each Solver in the network capable of fulfilling it - in this case, each Solver represents one of the available exchanges. Now imagine a Solver discovering that it is possible to minimize fees for the user by swapping the user’s ETH for USDC, then swapping USDC for BTC.

This series of trades are proposed and executed for the user, who receives only their desired outcome without the need to understand any intermediate steps.

In this way, the aggregator and Solvers perform arbitrage on behalf of individual users during their trades. Each party is compensated for their work, with the user receiving the optimal result despite intermediates receiving benefits.

#### Pro-social Social Media

Imagine the next big SocialFi app developed on Nimble’s intent protocol. Creators publish text, photo, and video content to their audience on the platform, and users can pay a small fee for each piece of new content.

To enable users to consume content for free, content creators may also choose to run ads instead of a subscription model. Advertisers can then pay to have the content delivered to users - paying both a small fee for the end user’s access to the platform, and paying the creator for the advertising.

One of the obstacles to creating a functional social network on blockchain is cost. Content on existing platforms is free, and supported by ads. SocialFi developers could easily develop their app to follow this behavior using Intents. Intents submitted to the social network to view a particular content could be matched to Advertising solvers. If the content was ad-supported, the advertiser would be incentivized to subsidize the network fees, allowing users to access it for free.

Since the network is built on a public blockchain, ad-supported content would be transparent to end users.\


### The Marketplace for Intents

The platforms of Web2 made the internet usable and accessible to all by rendering the complexity of computing and networking transparent.

Our marketplace for intents will make Web3 accessible by hiding the complexities of blockchain. People and developers from all backgrounds will be able to interact on a free and open marketplace, competing to provide a diverse set of solutions to each other's problems at the lowest cost.
