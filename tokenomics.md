# Tokenomics

### Nimble Tokenomics

This post details how the NIMBLE token is distributed to various participants of the Nimble Network and associated ecosystems. Thoughtful distribution of Nimble tokens is vital for on-chain governance and ensuring a fully decentralized, permissionless, and sustainable ecosystem.

Token-based governance enables token holders to guide the development of Nimble. The goal of this document is to prepare the community to participate in governance events so token holders can shape the future of the protocol productively.

#### Governance and the Nimble DAO

Nimble governance will aid in decision-making as we develop or alter network mechanisms in the future. The governance body is responsible for decisions such as:

* Selection of updates to be applied to programs across the blockchain
* Fee determination
* Reward determination
* Solver permissioning structures
* Updates to interpretation models

Additional topics may be added in the future, with approval by the DAO.

#### Distribution of Tokens

| Symbol         | NIMBLE                                                                                        |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Supply         | 1,000,000,000                                                                                 |
| Initial Supply | 100,000,000 (15%)                                                                             |
| Vesting        | 85% of NIMBLE are initially locked. Tokens are unlocked 6, 18, 30, and 42 months after launch |

#### Distribution Table

| Ecosystem      | 47      | 3       | 50      |
| -------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Solver Rewards | 18      | 2       |         |
| Development    | 10      | 0       | 10      |
| Private Sales  | 10      | 0       | 10      |
| Community      | 0       | 10      | 10      |
| **Total**      | **85%** | **15%** | **100** |

#### Solver Rewards

**20%, or 200,000,000 NIMBLE**

This reward allocation is reserved for the network’s Solver pool, or solvers.

Solvers contribute a variety of functionality to the Nimble protocol. This “Solver Rewards” allocation is a blend of tokens reserved for reward programs, grants, and scholarships that will encourage developers to build solvers.

20M NIMBLE are unlocked for immediate use to incentivize solver development. A remaining 180M NIMBLE are locked, subject to our vesting period as described earlier.

Upon unlocking, tokens will be made available for distribution to solvers.

#### Ecosystem

**50%, or 500,000,000 NIMBLE**

This reward allocation is reserved for those who contribute to the Nimble Network. Contributions may come from a variety of sources.

* Protocol developers
* App developers
* Educators
* Early solvers
* Early users

With this allocation, we hope to provide incentives and funding for projects to develop functionality with Nimble. Development may include ecosystem tools, educational events, or other action that increases awareness of Nimble.

3% of the ecosystem NIMBLE allocation is unlocked and can be distributed to this community immediately. The remaining 47% (470M) tokens will be distributed following our vesting schedule.

#### Development

**10%, or 100,000,000 NIMBLE**

The development allocation will be provided to projects or individuals that contribute to core components of the Nimble Network stack. Contributors to the core auction, interpretation stack, or dispatching layer may earn a stake of this allocation.

0% of development NIMBLE allocation is unlocked and can be distributed to developers immediately upon launch of the network. The remaining 10% will be distributed following our vesting schedule.

#### Private Sales

**10%, or 100,000,000 NIMBLE**

This allocation is reserved for early funding of the network development, as required by the core team. As of now, these tokens are unallocated.

0% of private sales NIMBLE allocation is unlocked and can be distributed to private investors immediately upon launch of the network. Once allocated, tokens from the private sale will be subject to the vesting schedule.

#### Community

**10%, or 100,000,000 NIMBLE**

The community allocation of NIMBLE is reserved for launch-related purposes.&#x20;

This includes launch events, marketing, and other events that will drive interest in the protocol.

Since this allocation is required for the immediate use of the network, it is unlocked immediately.

#### Conclusions

We are still actively working to launch the network. Once launched, expect additional announcements regarding NIMBLE governance. Follow along on our Twitter and Discord community pages for up-to-date information and to avoid inaccurate information about the Nimble project.
