#### Community Points System

You will now earn points for interacting with Nimbus communities. Points can be earned by creating posts, commenting, liking, and sharing Nimbus with your friends.

Additionally, points earned through our ambassador program will be awarded and tracked through Nimbus.

Ecosystem points will be used to track rewards in the Nimble ecosystem as part of our [community token allocation](https://docs.nimble.technology/intent-solicitation/tokenomics#community).

**Sort Posts**

Sort the best community posts to the top with the new "Top" community sorting option.

**Ranks and Member Badges**

Who are your community co-owners, and who are just humble guests?

Identify them using their ears. Also, identify the community's most influential members through their rank badges.
