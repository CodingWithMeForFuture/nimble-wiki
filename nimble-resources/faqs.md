# FAQs

#### Frequently Asked Questions:

1. What is the project vision?

Nimble is _**decentralizing Silicon Valley**_ with the composable AI protocol design.

The internet is the most powerful connective force in history. Billions of people across the globe communicate and transact in real-time. The data produced through our online activity powers the AI models that drive the digital economy.

Nimble is enabling an open economy for data and intelligence. Our composable AI protocol will provide a decentralized framework that enables AI models and data to be combined and reused. A network of interconnected AI agents, data providers, and compute resources replaces centralized platforms. Anyone can own, run, and train enterprise-grade AI over the decentralized network.

In the same way that Google made the worldâ€™s data accessible to all, Nimble aims to democratize the exchange of intelligence to enable permissionless innovation.

For more details, please refer to our [vision doc](https://docs.nimble.technology/).

2. What is the project roadmap?

Nimble is to enable AI demand by end of Q1 2024. This is followed by marketplace distribution mechanism in Q2 2024, together with the infrastructure launch.

For more details, please refer to our [roadmap doc](https://docs.nimble.technology/intent-solicitation/roadmap).

3. When will Nimble do exchange token listing?

To be aligned with the roadmap above, the token listing will happen right after the infrastructure launch by Q2 2024. If the infrastructure launch happens earlier than expected, the token listing will be ahead of the schedule as well.

4. What is Nimble tokenomics?

The following table shows high level token distributions. Please refer to the [tokenomics](https://docs.nimble.technology/intent-solicitation/tokenomics) doc for more info.

| **Total**           | **83%** | **17%**  | **100** |

5. How to become miners?

Once the miner SDKs are released, any developer can contribute and become miners following our miner governance policy. The policy will be released once it is ready. It is expected miners can contribute starting end of Q1 2024.

6. What are the potential security attacks and how to make the network secure?

There are various attack vectors, which are fully discussed in our [security blog](https://docs.nimble.technology/practical-intents/intent-verification-and-security).

7. What AI models and applications will be supported?

Nimble is building the composable AI protocol. The network supports generic purpose miners. It includes but not limited to an ecosystem built around AI models, social recommendations, DeFi operations, offline service requests and more.\
\
To jumpstart the network, Nimble will launch AI mining functionalities together with SDKs.\
\
After that, developers can build DApps for any types of AI applications.

For more info about the AI protocol design, please refer to the whitepaper and litepaper.

8. What are the network key innovations?

The network key innovations are discussed [here](https://docs.nimble.technology/intent-digest/key-innovations) for generic and scalable AI and marketplace support.

9. How to achieve network scalability?

The network is scalable with the unique network auction design and efficient AI operation dispatching algorithm.

For more info, please refer to the [whitepaper](https://docs.nimble.technology/intent-digest/whitepaper) for detailed modular auction design discussions, and [matching system blog](https://docs.nimble.technology/practical-intents/intent-matching-and-dispatching) for efficient matching and dispatching design discussions.

10. How to get community roles?

11. How to become community managers or moderators?

Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/9VgEwsA7xJ) and start contributing first. Then, you will naturally have opportunities to become community managers or moderators.

12. What is the GTM strategy?

Nimble builds the social and large action model first to jumpstart the network. This is followed by the infrastructure ecosystem building. The [roadmap](https://docs.nimble.technology/intent-solicitation/roadmap) and [community growth strategy](https://docs.nimble.technology/practical-intents/community-growth-strategy) docs have more detailed info on how to achieve this.

13. What is the network token utility and revenue model for the token?

Token appreciations come from infrastructure gas fees, model bids quoted by network token, and miner staking.

14. How are NIMBLE tokens created?

45% of tokens are reserved for mining and validating, being released within 48 months since token generation event (TGE). Each halving cycle has 2102400 blocks and each blockstep is 15 seconds.\
\
New tokens are produced every block at a fixed rate. Roughly 114.155251142 tokens are created per block at TGE. This will be halved every 12 months (i.e., 365 days). Newly minted tokens are shared among miners and validators equally. Validators stake to get network validation rewards.

The miners are AI model providers to provide real AI model solutions to the network.

15. Why do  NIMBLE tokens have value?

Each token is mapped to a real AI matching or model solution provision effort by miners and . With the growth of the network and halving very 12 months, it becomes more and more competitive to get minted NIMBLE tokens.

16. Why should I delegate my NIMBLE?

Everyone can delegate NIMBLE tokens to validators and earn staking rewards. Validators compete with each other to decide the percentage of staking rewards. The reward market introduces competitions among validators and improves the network robustness.
