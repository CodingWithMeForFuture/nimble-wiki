## Roadmap in Detail

During early 2024, we'll improve Nimbus with the following functionality. This roadmap may be adjusted based on feedback from our community members.

#### Community XP

We will implement XP in the community to encourage participation and track activity for internal purposes. XP will be earned on Nimbus through posting, commenting, receiving upvotes, and performing other activities in the Nimble community.

XP will be used as a signal to determine revenue share, provide community ranks, and ensure active Nimbus participants are compensated appropriately long-term.

#### Ecosystem Integration

To bring Nimbus functionality to existing communities, we will build an SDK to enable integration with other community hubs. Integration will begin with a bot for Discord, with support for other apps coming later.

The SDK will be used to distribute content from advertisers into connected communities and will allow users to execute intent operations (swap, transfer, stake, etc) directly from their community app of choice.

#### Buy a Membership with Intents

To make buying memberships easier, we’ll use Nimble’s intents to manage swaps and transfers, so you don’t need to own the correct token to buy a membership.

#### Visual Overhaul

Huge improvements to the product design are coming soon!

#### Tokenized Memberships

At launch, memberships are implemented as on-chain records in smart contracts. By tokenizing memberships, they can be made more accessible. You can buy partial memberships from other users or trade your current memberships on DEXs.

#### Income Streams - Advertising

Once communities become large, multiple methods of earning income will be possible. The first monetization method will be paid advertising. Advertisers can sponsor content to be shown in communities. The revenue from advertising will be divided among community members after a small network fee.

To begin, we will target Web3 native projects that wish to promote their event rewards, AMAs, airdrops, etc.

#### Community DAO

When memberships are purchased from a community, the funds remain in the community treasury after deducting protocol fees.

We will enable communities to vote on propositions to spend community funds. Our intended goal of these funds is to encourage community content creation. Still, we anticipate they will be used creatively and look forward to seeing interesting projects funded through communities.

#### Intents

Nimble is building Nimbus to aid in the development of social intents. Such intents aim to provide a consistent, reliable, simple interface to share and manage social data on-chain.

We will begin by working on advertising intents, which are well-suited to the auction structure of intent protocols. Later, we’ll implement sharing and content recommendation intents.

Once sufficient data is available on-chain through social intents, additional SocialFi applications can be developed on Nimble, and Nimbus development can be moved to the public sphere.

## Nimbus Launch Features

During closed beta, the following features will be supported.

#### 1. Buy a Membership

Memberships represent user ownership of the community. You can purchase a membership to our single launch community (Nimble) using ETH. Memberships are recorded as on-chain records.

#### 2. Create an Invite Link

During the closed beta, Nimbus is invite-only. Invitations will be issued manually by the Nimble team to select members of our Discord.

Once you become a member of a Nimbus community, you can issue invite links to allow others to join. Invite links are single-use. This discourages sybil attacks and restricts access to only early and active members.

#### 3. Create a Post

You can create posts in Nimbus to share content with the community. Other members can comment and vote on your posts.&#x20;

Posts are limited to text at launch, with new functionality to be added in the next few weeks.

#### 4. Sell Your Membership

You can exit your membership position by selling your membership using the community treasury.
