**Guest Access**

You can now join and participate in communities without purchasing a membership by becoming a guest.

Guests can participate in discussions and vote on posts, but won't be entitled to any revenue the community generates when advertising is implemented.

**Join Multiple Communities**

You can join multiple communities and switch between them using the community switcher.
